## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: What if I edit a cell but don't see the color change?
**A:** Colors only update when you click "Re-Run Validation". Make your edits, then re-validate to see updated colors.

### Q: Can I import even if there are errors?
**A:** No. The "Save to Database" button only appears when **ALL** validations pass. Fix all errors first.

### Q: What if I make a mistake while editing?
**A:** Just edit the cell again and re-run validation. You can fix it as many times as needed.

### Q: Can I go back to Excel if I want?
**A:** Yes! Just close this tab and edit your Excel file. But with this feature, you probably won't need to! 😊

### Q: How do I know which field is duplicate in a RED row?
**A:** Usually it's the LedgerName. Look for similar names in other rows and make one unique.

### Q: Will my edits be saved if I close the tab?
**A:** No. Edits are only in memory until you click "Save to Database". Don't close the tab before importing!
