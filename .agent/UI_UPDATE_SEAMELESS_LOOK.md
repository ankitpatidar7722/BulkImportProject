# ✅ UI Updated: Seamless "First Image" Look

## 🎨 Visual Changes

I've updated the data grid to match your preferred "First Image" style:

1. **Seamless Inputs**: Removed the white boxes. Inputs are now transparent.
2. **Visible Data**: Text is now white on the dark row background, making it clearly visible.
3. **Clean Grid**: Removed clunky borders. The grid looks like a proper data table now.

## 🔴🔵🟡 Validation Colors

Validation colors remain **highly visible** but only appear when needed:

- **Missing Data (Blue)**: Background becomes Blue, text becomes Black.
- **Mismatch (Yellow)**: Background becomes Yellow, text becomes Black.
- **Duplicates (Red)**: Entire row background is Red.

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Reload Page**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Hard Reload).
2. **View Grid**: You should see clean white text on dark rows (no white boxes).
3. **Run Validation**: Error cells will light up in Blue/Yellow/Red.

The "invisible data" issue (white text on white box) is now fixed because the white box is gone!
